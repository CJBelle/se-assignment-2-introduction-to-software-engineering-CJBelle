# SE-Assignment-2

Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software is defined as the internal components such as the programs, data and other components used to carry out the necassary instructions to carry out activities. Examples include: the Operating system that interacts with the user, the hardware and the computer (the user uses the hardware (Mouse, touchpad, etc) to instruct the computer to go to the browser and play music through spotify. The operating system uses the user's input to intruct the computer using computer language. The computer will then use other internal software/s to carry out the instruction and play the music.)

Engineering the the disapline that uses Science and Math to persue a solution for a problem.

Therefore to conclude Software enginnering is defined by using engineering (Math and Science) to design, develop, test and maintain a program or a set of programs to solve an issue.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering has a broad oversight into software development and ensuring that the software created meets the requirements and can continally be improved on and maintaned. As stated before engineering uses Math and Science to create these processes.

SE uses the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a means to ensure that at every stage of the cycle the initial objectives and requirements will be met and

This goes beyond programming and development infact this disapline

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

The phases in the SDLC is intergral to the development of the program and ensuring the quality of the program.

The phases

Phase 1: Planning and Analysis: This is were engineers with the end-user to find out their need. This stages allows the engineer to use the information / data from the user and test if this need is worth developing a product. This also allows engineers to see if the have the capacity to go forward with this. This stage is more of how can the team handle the development of this program
Phase 2: Define Requirements: Once planning around the product is done, the engineers will then use the information gathered in phase one and now interpret that information in a way that will make sense in the design stage.
Phase 3: Design: after interpreting the requirements now we develope the funcitionality and look of the program
Phase 4: Coding: Creating the program
Phase 5: Testing: Ensuring that the program works
Phase 6: Deployment: Releasing the program/software to the client/end-user
Phase 7: Maintenance: Receive feedback and continual maintenance

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
